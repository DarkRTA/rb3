# NOTE: This should later be replaced by autoconf/automake scripts, but for
# the time being this is actually pretty clean. The only ugly part is
# handling CFLAGS so that the x86 specific optimizations don't break
# a build. This is easy to remedy though, for those that have problems.

# Clean the stack after sensitive functions.  Not always required...

#You can also customize the Twofish code.  All four combinations 
#of the flags are possible but only three of them make sense.
#
#Both undefined:  Very fast, requires ~4.2KB of ram per scheduled key
#Both defined  :  Slow, requires only ~100 bytes of ram per scheduled key
#
#If defined on their own
#_SMALL defined:  Very Slow, small code only ~100 bytes of ram
#_TABLES defined: Very fast, not faster than if both were undefined.  Code is ~1KB bigger
#                 faster keysetup though...

# Small Ram Variant of Twofish.  For this you must have TWOFISH defined.  This
# variant requires about 4kb less memory but is considerably slower.  It is ideal
# when high throughput is less important than conserving memory. By default it is
# not defined which means the larger ram (about 4.2Kb used) variant is built.
# CFLAGS += -DTWOFISH_SMALL

# Tell Twofish to use precomputed tables.  If you want to use the small table
# variant of Twofish you may want to turn this on.  Essentially it tells Twofish to use
# precomputed S-boxes (Q0 and Q1) as well as precomputed GF multiplications [in the MDS].
# This speeds up the cipher somewhat.
# CFLAGS += -DTWOFISH_TABLES 

#Small code variant of the SAFER+ cipher, uses same RAM but less code space
#With this defined the cipher is slower.  On my x86 with GCC 3.2 it required 50KB less space

#Use fast PK routines.  Basically this limits the size of the private key in the
