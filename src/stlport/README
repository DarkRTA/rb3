This directory contains a modified version of the STLport-5.0 release
tailored towards this project.

What's inside :

README           - this file
stlport          - main STLport include directory
src              - source for iostreams implementation and other parts
                   that aren't pure template code

Modifications:
- Auxillary files such as the makefiles and tests have been removed
  to greatly reduce file count (~680 -> 379).
- Custom configuration files have been added for the compiler/platform
  being used, along with other config modifications.
- Redefinitions of stdin/stdout/stderr in stdio.h have been disabled,
  as they caused build errors in .c files.
- A new StlNodeAlloc allocator has been added to match the binary.
