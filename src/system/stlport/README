# STLport 5.0.2

Sourced from https://sourceforge.net/projects/stlport/files/STLport/STLport%205.0.2/

Modifications are made as needed to suit the decompilation project, including but not limited to:

- Only the `stlport` directory has been included from the original package, as STLport iostreams/locale/etc. code are not necessary for this project.
- Additional compiler configuration headers [`config/stl_mwbroadway.h`](config/stl_mwbroadway.h) and [`config/stl_mwgecko.h`](config/stl_mwgecko.h) have been added to support MWCC for GC/Wii.
- A custom allocator is used as the default allocator instead of `std::allocator`.
- A modified version of `vector` has been introduced which accepts a third template parameter for the integer type used for size/capacity, based on symbol/RTTI names and decompiled code.

Any other important modifications or hacks can be found by searching for `// decomp hack:` inside this folder.
